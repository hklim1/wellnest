a## Setup For the Project

This is just a simple setup for the project booted with typeScript and I have added expo router.
It's a file based router like Next JS App Router that derives the router from file structure.

setup commands i ran

```
npx create-expo-app@latest -t
```

Then I Selected Blank TypeScript

After that I followed these steps
